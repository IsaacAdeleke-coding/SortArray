# SortArray

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in C++. The program sorts a fixed-size array of integers and displays the state of the array after each comparison and swap.

## Features

- **Bubble Sort Algorithm**: The sorting algorithm is implemented step-by-step, swapping adjacent elements if they are out of order.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: After each comparison and possible swap, the current state of the array is printed to the console, allowing users to follow the sorting process in detail.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SortArray.git
